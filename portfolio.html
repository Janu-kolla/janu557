                Nature is an important and integral part of mankind. It is one of the greatest blessings for human life;
                 however, nowadays humans fail to recognize it as one. Nature has been an inspiration for numerous poets, 
                 writers, artists and more of yesteryears. This remarkable creation inspired them to write poems and stories 
                 in the glory of it. They truly valued nature which reflects in their works even today. Essentially, nature 
                 is everything we are surrounded by like the water we drink, the air we breathe, the sun we soak in, the 
                 birds we hear chirping, the moon we gaze at and more. Above all, it is rich and vibrant and consists of both
                  living and non-living things. Therefore, people of the modern age should also learn something from people of 
                  yesteryear and start valuing nature before it gets too late.Nature is an important and integral part of mankind.

                Leave the road, take the trails. —Pythagoras

13.              Live in each season as it passes; breathe the air, drink the drink, taste the fruit, 
                 and resign yourself to the influence of the earth. —Henry David Thoreau
                I go to nature to be soothed and healed, and to have my senses put in order. —John Burroughs
                It is not so much for its beauty that the forest makes a claim upon men's hearts, as for that 
                subtle something, that quality of air that emanation from old trees, that so wonderfully changes 
                and renews a weary spirit. —Robert Louis Stevenson
